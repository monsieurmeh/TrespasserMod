# Trespasser: A Stepping Stone from Stalker to Interloper #

This mod adds a new distinct difficulty mode between Stalker and Interloper called Trespasser.

I built this mod for multiple reasons:

1) To provide a reasonable transition from Stalker to Interloper. Having played both extensively, the contrast is vast compared to stalker and voyager. Once you can handle the difficulty ramp of "more wildlife" it just becomes "more food". Being both restricted in your starting areas **and** not being able to pick which one makes practice more difficult. The combined hard restriction on banned items **and** sharp decrease in general loot availability make the transition feel like stepping from paradise to desolation - not quite the transition I always envisioned.
2) To proivide a reasonable permanent playstyle between Stalker and Interloper. Having made the transition successfully over 1000+ hours, I still find myself always wanting to live between the two. I dislike setting up my custom game each time, and the settings are still gated to typical "interloper" or "stalker" - no midpoint. As such this difficulty has settings geared about 65% towards Interloper.

# Features #
* Distinct, selectable difficutly mode between Interloper and Stalker called Trespasser with original art from Flower Field.
* Interloper-**like** loot table: Although the standard interloper loot table is used (baseline resource availability = LOW) this mod allows a rare chance (default: 10%) for interloper-banned items like hatches, axes and other situation-specific entries to spawn. The 20 hatches you found last stalker game? Prepare to find two, if you're lucky!
* Reduced but not empty prepper caches: The above chance to find rare loot will be used to inversely de-populate prepper caches from the stalker loot table, allowing you to still identify which caches are which but providing substantially less loot overall. This will compound with the chance to spawn interloper banned items, resulting in almost no chance to get such items in prepper caches.
* Custom stats tracking for Trespasser (FUTURE): Adds a new column and permanent tracking to the journal statistics screen.
